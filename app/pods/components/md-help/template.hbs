    The mdEditor is a web application that allows users to author and
    edit metadata for projects and datasets. The primary design goal is
    to develop an editor that will allow creation and management of
    archival quality metadata without requiring extensive knowledge of
    metadata standards.

    A comprehensive User Manual is available. The manual includes a tutorial,
reference, and best practices.
