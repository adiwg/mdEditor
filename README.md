### Branching

### Building ToC

To autogenerate a ToC (table of contents) for this README,
run `yarn doc:toc`.  Please update the ToC whenever editing the structure
of README.

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
* Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).

### Building Application for Production

To build this UI for production, run the following commads from this folder:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

### Running Tests

- `npm test` runs full tests in random order with coverage
- `ember test --server`

Keep in mind that tests are executed in random order.  This is intentional
and helps to prevent hard-to-debug order dependencies among tests.

Please also note that we report test coverage.  We strive for "the right amount
of testing".  Use test coverage as a guide to help you identify untested
high-value code.

We rely on `ember-a11y-testing` to validate accessibility in acceptance tests.
If you write acceptance tests, please ensure at least one validation per
route using `await a11yAudit();`.

### Deploying

By default, this will deploy to GitHub pages:

 `ember deploy staging`

 Note that the `gh-pages` branch must exist in the git repository. See [ember-cli-deploy-git](https://github.com/ef4/ember-cli-deploy-git#usage) for details.
