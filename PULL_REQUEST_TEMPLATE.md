## Guidelines

### Create issue first

Please do not create a Pull Request without creating an issue first.
Any change needs to be discussed before proceeding.
Failure to do so may result in the rejection of the pull request.

### Test plan

Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes UI.

Make sure tests pass on both Travis CI.

### Code formatting

See the CONTRIBUTING.md

### Closing issues

Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).
